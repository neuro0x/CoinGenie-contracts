## Reporting a Vulnerability

### First and foremost: Thank you!

If you have discovered a potential security issue in CoinGenie, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Process:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Public disclosure can put the entire community at risk. If you have discovered a potential vulnerability, we would appreciate you reporting it to us in confidence.
2. **Send Us a Detailed Report**: Mail us at [security@coingenie.io](mailto:security@coingenie.io). Provide a detailed report, explaining the nature of the issue. The more information you can provide, the better. Ideally, your report would include a proof of concept or clear test case, demonstrating the vulnerability.
3. **Allow Us Time**: We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address any issue you identify. After we have fixed the vulnerability, we will credit you for your discovery.

## What to Expect:

- When you report an issue, you should expect an acknowledgment from us within 48 hours.
- We will keep you informed as we move forward to address the issue you have identified.
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure after the issue has been resolved.

## Smart Contract Audits

Before our dApp reached the mainnet, our smart contracts underwent thorough reviews and audits. However, as with any software, there's always a chance that something might get missed. If you believe you've found a smart contract vulnerability, please refer to the process above.

## Bug Bounty Program

We recognize and reward security researchers who help us ensure the safety of our dApp. If you report a valid and previously unknown vulnerability, you might be eligible for a reward. The size of the reward will be determined based on the severity of the vulnerability.

## Stay Updated

Ensure you always use the latest version of CoinGenie. We continuously improve the security and functionality of our dApp. By staying updated, you ensure you are protected by the latest security patches.
